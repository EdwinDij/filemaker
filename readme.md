# Projekta CLI

Projekta is a powerful CLI (Command Line Interface) that streamlines the process of creating frontend and backend projects. With an intuitive command-line interface, Projekta automates project creation for various languages and frameworks.

## Installation

To use Projekta, ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system. Then, install Projekta globally by running the following command:
```bash
npm install -g projekta
```



## Usage

To start using Projekta, simply run the following command:

npx projekta
```


The CLI offers two specialties to choose from: Frontend and Backend. If you select "Frontend," Projekta provides a list of popular frontend languages and frameworks, including React, Vue, Angular, Preact, Lit, Svelte, Solid, and Qwik. On the other hand, if you choose "Backend," Projekta offers backend languages and frameworks such as Express, NestJS, Python, and Django.

Once you make your selection, Projekta automatically generates the project's basic structure, installs the required dependencies, and opens the project in your default code editor.

- `@inquirer/prompts`: A library for interactive prompts.
